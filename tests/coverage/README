Used to produce coverage reports from the automated tests
via jscoverage (http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/).

You'll need to install jscoverage first.
You'll also need Google Chrome.

Then:

$ cd tests/test-coverage
$ ./instrument.sh

See the Summary tab for the coverage report.

This is only tested on Linux.
